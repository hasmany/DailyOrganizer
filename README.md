A user can input tasks that needs to be done. Clicking the check icon marks the task as complete, while the x button deletes the current task. The list of tasks can be toggled between active, inactive, or all by the buttons on the bottom. Active shows tasks that are currently incompleted, or not yet checked off. Inactive shows tasks that are incompleted. All shows all tasks. Clear completed will remove all inactive tasks.
